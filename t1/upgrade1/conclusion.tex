\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the mentioned circuit has been
achieved. Voltages and Current statics analyses have been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
precisely. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ.
