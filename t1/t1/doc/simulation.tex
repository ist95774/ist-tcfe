  \caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}

\end{table}



Table~\ref{tab:tabela3} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, the simulation analysis results are the same
due to all components having a linear behaviour.
