% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a voltage source $V_a$, a current source $I_d$, 
a linear voltage dependent current source $I_b$, a linear current dependent voltage source $V_c$ and multiple resistors $R1,...,R7$.
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
