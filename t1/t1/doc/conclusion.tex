\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the mentioned circuit has been
achieved. Voltages and Current static analyses have been performed both
theoretically using the Octave tools and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tools. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
precisely and both theoretical analyses produce consistent results. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ.
